                  A handful of credit unions (Safe Harbor Financial, Partner

                  They charge <strong>$2,000&ndash;$5,000/month</strong> in

              A seller creates a wallet (a cryptographic keypair), a buyer sends

              A wallet alone is insufficient for enterprise treasury management.
              Cannabis businesses need the same governance controls as any

              limits, and audit trails.

              The Exile Tax is not a market inefficiency that competition will
              solve. It is a structural consequence of federal drug policy
              meeting an inflexible banking system. Every solution that depends
              on a bank account &mdash; credit unions, high-risk processors,
              cashless ATMs, ACH workarounds &mdash; inherits the same single
              point of failure: the bank can leave.

              Non-custodial stablecoin settlement eliminates that dependency
              entirely. USDC on Solana provides sub-second finality at $0.001
              per transaction, backed by a{" "}
              <strong>$55&nbsp;billion reserve pool</strong> of U.S. Treasuries,
              under the{" "}
              <strong>GENIUS Act&rsquo;s federal oversight framework</strong>,
              with <strong>Squads&nbsp;Protocol multisig governance</strong> for
              enterprise treasury controls.

              The only way to payment-infrastructure a debanked industry is to
              build a rail that doesn&rsquo;t need a bank.
